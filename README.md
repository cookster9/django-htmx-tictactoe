Years ago I flubbed an interview question that asked me to implement tictactoe in object oriented programming. Fast forward to now, I wanted to practice HTMX, so I figured I could take another crack at tictactoe and might as well make the game logic in an object oriented way to redeem myself. Along the way I found Tailwind CSS and took this chance to try that out too.
